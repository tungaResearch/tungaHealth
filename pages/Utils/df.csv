However, the inconsistency in staff behavior is a notable issue, with some being friendly while others display rudeness toward patients. Despite its status as a National referral hospital, the limited operating hours of the outpatient wing from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm contribute to excessively long queues and extended waiting times. Patients often arrive as early as 5:00 am, highlighting the demand for services outside these hours. Activating a 24-hour working mode for outpatient services would be a prudent step to alleviate these challenges and enhance accessibility for the community.

The medical care provided is of high quality, and I have confidence in the competence of the healthcare professionals.

However, my overall experience as a patient was significantly marred by the hospital's operational inefficiencies and lackluster patient services. One glaring issue is the inconvenience faced when dealing with patients who are bedridden or unable to walk. The absence of readily available beds or wheelchairs creates a frustrating scenario where one has to navigate the hospital in search of essential mobility aids.

The ergonomic design of the hospital seems counterintuitive, especially when compared to other reputable medical facilities. This layout flaw can be distressing for patients and their caregivers, impacting the overall patient experience negatively.

Another notable shortcoming is the disjointed process of obtaining medicines. Having to order medications from a pharmacy located a considerable distance away, followed by a separate journey to one of the few pay kiosks, presents a logistical challenge. The long distances and the limited number of payment points contribute to overcrowding and inefficiency, causing unnecessary delays and frustration for patients and their families.

In summary, while the medical expertise at Kenyatta National Hospital is commendable, there is a pressing need for improvement in the hospital's overall patient experience. Addressing issues related to patient mobility, ergonomics, and streamlining the pharmacy payment process would undoubtedly contribute to a more efficient and compassionate healthcare environment. The hospital has the potential to offer a seamless and patient-centric experience with a strategic focus on these areas of improvement.",{},1.0,0.8707,positive,must commend kenyatta national hospital housing exceptional doctor exhibit commendable expertise professionalism medical care provided high quality confidence competence healthcare professional however overall experience patient significantly marred hospital operational inefficiency lackluster patient service one glaring issue inconvenience faced dealing patient bedridden unable walk absence readily available bed wheelchair creates frustrating scenario one navigate hospital search essential mobility aid ergonomic design hospital seems counterintuitive especially compared reputable medical facility layout flaw distressing patient caregiver impacting overall patient experience negatively another notable shortcoming disjointed process obtaining medicine order medication pharmacy located considerable distance away followed separate journey one pay kiosk present logistical challenge long distance limited number payment point contribute overcrowding inefficiency causing unnecessary delay frustration patient family summary medical expertise kenyatta national hospital commendable pressing need improvement hospital overall patient experience addressing issue related patient mobility ergonomics streamlining pharmacy payment process would undoubtedly contribute efficient compassionate healthcare environment hospital potential offer seamless patient - centric experience strategic focus area improvement,4,Staff and Care Quality

About their private wing, if you have other options take them and if you don't, God help you.
Before you leave a patient in that hospital bed, make sure they're squared away because there's only one nurse for an entire wing and no one will get to your patient in the next six hours.
Incase your patient has dietary restrictions, hunt down a member of the kitchen staff and say something. It doesn't matter if that information is in the patient's file or you told every nurse and doctor you've come across, that information will not get to the kitchen staff.
Also, they don't really cater for dietary restrictions. For example if you're diabetic and the hospital is serving white rice, soggy cabbage and some sort of beans stew for lunch, you'll get lot's of beans, a little rice and soggy cabbage and a patient without restrictions will get lots of rice, a spoonful of beans and soggy cabbage.

You'll pay for a private room and you'll get: a broken bed, a very dusty closet and a room where paint is peeling right off the wall.

If you take medication, say insulin,talk to your nurse who will forget about that. Then remind him/her over and over again( that is if you see them).
And when you'll be in pain, vumilia my friend. No one gives a damn.
