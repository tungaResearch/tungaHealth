0,Kenyatta National Hospital,"Affordability, and Accessibility",Nowadays no unnecessary referrals so the number of people has reduced
1,Kenyatta National Hospital,"Affordability, and Accessibility","The worst experience ever. I have been here since 8am, private wing. Supporsed to see a do tor in room 14. It's now 11:52am almost midday the doctor is not yet here. For how long is someone supposed to wait on the queue. You need to improve the services being a level 5 hospital. Can you get committed doctors who work with normal working hours. Surely we are really failing. The consultation we have paid ksh.2800 is this still not worth it? Wanyonge watatewa na nani?"
2,The Mombasa Hospital,"Affordability, and Accessibility","I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the maternity services at The Mombasa Hospital. Last month, I visited the hospital to begin my prenatal care.
On my first visit, there was no gynecologist available, and I was advised to undergo an ultrasound scan, with the results to be reviewed by the gynecologist the following week.

However, when I returned as instructed, the gynecologist was again unavailable. Instead, I was given folic acid medication by another staff member and was told to return in two weeks, when the gynecologist would supposedly be available. Today, after driving a considerable distance, I was informed that the gynecologist was still not available and was told to return the following day.

The lack of a consistent and reliable schedule for gynecological care has been a significant inconvenience and source of frustration. As a working professional, the repeated need to take time off and travel long distances is both wasteful and disruptive.

Given that The Mombasa Hospital is a prominent private healthcare provider in the area, this lack of organization and communication is particularly disappointing. It is unacceptable that such a facility cannot provide reliable access to essential maternal healthcare services.

I urge others considering their maternity care options to look elsewhere, as my experience has been overwhelmingly negative. The hospital's claim of having only one gynecologist seems questionable and reflects poorly on their ability to provide adequate care.

I hope that this feedback will be taken seriously and that improvements will be made to ensure better service for future patients."

Visit at your own expense."
8,Kenyatta National Hospital,"Affordability, and Accessibility","There's a story that was on telly a few years back on how patients would be on corridors for days waiting to get admitted at KNH without getting a bed. The patients needed urgent medical attention... and the then me, brushed this aside as lies coz I mean, how can a hospital do that? Fast forward to 5th March around noon, I took my 4 month old baby there who was convulsing and had to wait till 11:30pm to get a bed, let alone get admitted. As my baby kept getting convulsion after convulsion, my heart sank. There's a time I watched it happen coz trying to call the doctor who was just in the next consultation room proved useless. Huku, ndo ata upate attention ya daktari ni kujuana. If you don't even know nani wa kupewa kitu kidogo, utangoja hadi wachoke na wewe ndo wakutafutie kitanda! We were at the private wing for slightly over a week and the bill hit the roof with exaggerated figures, cooked numbers and duplicated items. Following up with the Accounts guys turned out to be a wild goose chase. The doctors take their sweet time to ensure you stay for the longest time possible; such a shame! Something that's supposed to take a day will be dragged for at least 3 days. The younger nurses are however really good; then there are the older ones that even shake when administering medication. I thank God my baby got well, but my overall customer experience was simply awful."

10,The Mombasa Hospital,Facility Feedback,You are very poor in terms of delivering babies and you should be ashamed of that keeping in mind your path is to help the sick and you can't even succefully deliver someone's child.Shame on you.
11,Kenyatta National Hospital,Facility Feedback,"Although it had some tough times with the management, it is an hospital that could solve many cases of illness particularly to the common mwananchi."
12,Kenyatta National Hospital,Facility Feedback,This is the worst hospital nowadays u reach here at 5:00am and ur served late like 9:00am they talk rudely something has to be done the waiting area is congested not enough chairs it doesnt even deserve any star
13,The Mombasa Hospital,Facility Feedback,"Vacationers, just never get sick in Kenya and above all, don't go to Mombasa Hospital!!! You just get fleeced there and leave as an impoverished person!

I was in Mombasa Hospital from February 8th to February 11th, 2017 because of severe diarrhea, high blood pressure, severe bronchitis, circulatory problems, and weakness. Had to make a €2,000 deposit first before anything was done. The treatment at the outpatient station was okay so far. I came to a private single room on the upper floor, the bed had an old sagging mattress, a lumpy pillow, zero comfort, the wind whistled through the room like organ pipes. Medical care was fine, I was pumped full of infusions and medication. With the exception of two very nice women, the nurses were anything but helpful, unfriendly, impolite and they made me clearly feel that I was a ""supposedly"" rich old ""Mzungu"" European woman. I'm not rich or anything. The €5,000 I had to pay was my entire savings...The food was horrible, absolutely not edible in my condition with intestinal problems, there was the same food every day. I had to constantly ask for water, got 2 x 1 cups of tea a day, otherwise only water, for breakfast 2 pieces of bread, 1 mini piece of margerine and some jam, 1 cup, and lived on some rice and bland boiled vegetables. There was always an enormous level of noise in the hallway and in the rooms next door due to the staff and the many visitors with even more children, ruckus, noise, screaming, often until midnight! My blood pressure rose day by day as I felt worse and worse. On February 11th I wanted to have an invoice as to what I should pay. I was presented with a bill for 491,897 schillings = 4,981.97 euros for this 4 day treatment!! With the information that Europeans would have to pay significantly more! My blood pressure then rose to more than 185. The doctor said I couldn't be released - probably to make me look even more like a Christmas goose!!! - but I called the tour guide who was supposed to pick me up immediately. I immediately booked an early return flight (I still had 2 weeks in the hotel...) and had to grudgingly pay the 4,981.97 euros. Thank God I had 5,000 euros in my Visa account, otherwise I would have looked old. Since my cash resources were low and I needed further medical attention, I had to fly home immediately.
Since February 14th I have been back home and receiving good medical care. No additional costs! I will never set foot on African soil again!"

15,The Mombasa Hospital,Facility Feedback,"I am at the hospital right now. I have not yet gone to see the doctor but I already have a bad experience with one of the nurses at the reception desk. I don't understand why registration should take more than 15 minutes. Then when I raise my concern on the waiting time because I was feeling dizzy this was her response 'tusiharibiane siku tadadhali'. I  honestly did not expect such langunage from a hospital staff, let alone someone stationed at the customer service desk."

19,Kenyatta National Hospital,Facility Feedback,"I blindly believed the negative hearsay about the hospital.....however,after my sister's admission, I have wondered why pple pay exorbitant fees for medical attention in private hospitals....kenyatta hospital is no longer what it used to be.....it is a completely transformed service , .nurses are extremely friendly,efficient, ....in a nutshell, the service is on point .....5 star especially to nurses/doctors on 7th floor....Nurse Munyi and your team,you are exceptional...be blessed....#rheumatology wing..

20,The Mombasa Hospital,Hospital Services,"This place is thevimg money from sick patients
All Out patients coming to the hospital after 5pm are being charged double. I thought this hospitals was there to serve the sick but seems it there to rob the unfortunates who have to visit it after five pm.. pathetic"
21,Moi Teaching And Referral Hospital,Hospital Services,This hospital is currently busy in training and support for the students put they don't care about health and safety to patients this is because patients die soon I will report to media
22,The Mombasa Hospital,Hospital Services,"DON'T GET YOUR COVID19 PCR TEST HERE.
Took a PCR test and the results came back positive.. went to the border post to get a PCR test and the results came back negative.
You'll risk missing your flight!"
23,Moi Teaching And Referral Hospital,Hospital Services,"Biggest public hospital after Kenyatta National Hospital. It has separate maternity, Paediatric hospital and cancer centre"
24,Moi Teaching And Referral Hospital,Hospital Services,"A teaching, research and referral hospital MTRH serving the North rift, western and nearly regions. Well equipped and attends to emergency medical cases from the region."
25,Kenyatta National Hospital,Hospital Services,"A failed national hospital.
It has rude, demotivated staff, I wonder whether there is anything that can be done to restore hope in this hospital.

A doctor there personally encouraged me to go to KU referral hospital having been referred to KNH at first.

I will be back there at my death lap. Paid money for consultancy but never got attended to."

29,The Mombasa Hospital,Hospital Services,A bit confusing to navigate if you are new. It is a decent hospital to get vaccination shots for travel purposes.
30,Kenyatta National Hospital,Improvement Areas,The hospital has no idea of what an emergency is. They keep patients to raise money instead of serving them to go home. It has taken 3 weeks and counting for an accident patient to be attended in the wards despite him needing surgery to enable him leave and go to bury his wife who died in the accident.  If I  get sick please those who handle me shouldn't consider KNH. Please.
31,The Mombasa Hospital,Improvement Areas,"Worst customer service,I think some workers have overstayed there untill they dont feel pain of patients,"
32,The Mombasa Hospital,Improvement Areas,"Pathetic services. Very slow service delivery. Keeping patients for long before attending them.
How can a post treatment review by a doctor take a whole 8 hours ? And they don’t care."

37,The Mombasa Hospital,Improvement Areas,"Why can the one station where you register, take card payment and enter all details into the system? Time waste and higher risk for everyone, the current system. Now person who takes sample has left... Lot's of timewaste and unnecessary delay.. look into your system. one stop instead of hunting with a paper through the hospital..."

40,Kenyatta National Hospital,Staff and Care Quality ,"The place is like a maze. Navigating within the facility is very difficult, time consuming, and frustrating. You may end up queuing in the wrong place for hours. Few doctors and nurses are kind and really nice, majority have no empathy at all."
